# PRN212_PROJECT
This project is about fast food restaurant management and ordering features. On the side of staff(owner, staff, cooker), we provide the ability to manage  every combo, dish, ingredient source, view coming orders, prepare orders, and mark orders as done. The restaurant owner can view the reported statistics by day, week, month, or year which facilitates tracking restaurant status and adjusting staff's authorization in the system. On the other side of the customer, we provide a screen to allow customers to order directly at the store(like a tablet in mc donal), and feedback to import the restaurant's services.
